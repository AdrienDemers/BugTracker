### BugTracker Web App for Programmer or Programming Team

## Task
Build a bug tracking app with a backend to log bugs and improve team collaboration.
  - Managers should be able to have multiple projects and add programmers' account to projects.
  - Users should be able to add comments to logged bugs.


## Tech
I used Firebase as the backend because I knew it was simple.

## Functionality
Bugs are logged by the users. Upon account creation user chooses either programmer of manager account type.
